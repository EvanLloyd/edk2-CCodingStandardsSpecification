# 3 Quick Reference

## 3.1 Naming

* Names must clearly represent the purpose of the named object. See "General
  Naming Rules".

* Do not use names that are very similar to existing concepts, such as 'event'.
  See "General Naming Rules".

* Do not use the names of symbols declared in standard header files as internal
  symbols. See "Function and Data Names".

* Overloading function or type names is not allowed. "Name Space Rules".

* Use the correct opposites when naming. See "Common Opposites in Variable
  Names".

* Use standard abbreviations only. See "Abbreviation Usage".

* Use industry standard acronyms only. See "Acronym Usage".

* Any nonstandard abbreviation or acronym must be defined in the file header of
  any file using the abbreviation or acronym. See "Abbreviation Usage" and
  "Glossary".

* There is no limit to name lengths. A length of 10 to 30 characters is
  recommended. See "File Names" & "Identifiers that are always reserved".

* File names must not start with numbers. See "File Names".

* Each include file name must be unique. See "Include Files".

* File, function, variable, enumeration, and data structure elements must have
  names like the following: `EachWordIsDistinctEvenAcronymsLikeAcpi`.
  See "Identifiers".

* Don't capitalize all letters in acronyms. `MyPCIAddress` is hard to read,
  compared to `MyPciAddress`, especially if acronyms are mixed with numbers,
  like `My870PCIBus0BDF`. See "Acronym Usage".

* Acronyms in comments and documentation shall follow English rules and be
  capitalized. See "Acronym Usage".

* Functional macros, `#defines`, and `typedefs` must have names like:
  `EACH_WORD_IS_DISTINCT_EVEN_ACRONYMS_LIKE_ACPI` See "Type and Macro Names".

* Hungarian naming is not allowed. See "Hungarian Prefixes".

* Global data names must be prefaced with a '`g`'. Example: `gMyGuid`. See
  "Global & Module Variables".

* Module global data names must be prefaced with an '`m`'. Example: `mMyGuid`.
  See "Global & Module Variables".

## 3.2 Formatting

### 3.2.1 Formatting: General Rules

* Tab characters are not allowed. See "General Rules".

* All indentation (tabs) is two spaces. See "General Rules".

### 3.2.2 Formatting: Vertical spacing

* Use blank lines and comments to group blocks of related code. See "Vertical
  Spacing".

* Never put more than one statement per line. See "Vertical Spacing".

* Never put the code and conditional on one line. See "Vertical Spacing

* Never put more than one declaration per line. `UINT8 MyData1, MyData2;` is
  illegal. See "Vertical Spacing".

* Always put open braces '`{`' on their own line for functions or multi-line
  predicate expressions. All other uses put the brace following the
  conditional. See "Vertical Spacing".

* Always put close braces '`}`' on their own line, indented to match the first
  line of the construct. Exceptions are `else`, `else if`, and `do-while` code.
  See "Vertical Spacing".

### 3.2.3 Formatting: Horizontal spacing

* Always put space before and after binary operators. See "Horizontal Spacing".

* Never put space between unary operators and the operand. See "Horizontal
  Spacing".

* Always put space after '`,`', or '`;`' if more code follows. See "Horizontal
  Spacing".

* Always put space before a '`(`' except for '`((`'. See "Horizontal Spacing".

* Always put space before a '`{`' if it is not on its own line. See "Horizontal
  Spacing".

* Never put spaces around '`.`' or '`->`' operators. See "Horizontal Spacing".

* Never put a space between array operands and '`[`'. See "Horizontal Spacing".

* Always Line up continued lines with the element being continued. See
  "Horizontal Spacing".

### 3.2.4 Formatting: Predicate Expressions

* Always use parentheses rather than relying on "Horizontal Spacing" (above)
  operator precedence. "Predicate Expressions".

* Booleans do not need to be compared with `TRUE` or `FALSE`. See "Predicate
  Expressions".

* Pointers must be explicitly compared to `NULL`. See "Predicate Expressions".

* Numbers must be explicitly compared to another number. See "Predicate
  Expressions".

## 3.3 Files: General Rules

* Do not use tabs, only use Spaces. "General Rules".

* Unless explicitly stated otherwise, spaces (white space) may be one or more
  space characters long. See "General Rules".

* Files may only contain the ASCII characters 0x0A, 0x0D, and 0x20 through
  0x7E, inclusive. See "General Rules".

* Do not produce lines that exceed 120 columns in your source files. See
  "General Rules".

* New files shall not use `#pragma` except for `#pragma pack(#)`. See "General
  Rules".

  + Ported files may retain pre-existing `#pragma`s. See "General Rules".

  + Ported files may contain `#pragma`s to disable prevalent warning messages.

* All lines must end with CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed); 0x0D followed by
  0x0A.

* All files must end with CRLF. See "General Rules".

* Every new file must begin with a "File Heading" comment block. See "File
  Heading"

### 3.3.1 Files: Horizontal Spacing

* Always put space before and after binary operators. See "Horizontal Spacing".

* Do not put space between unary operators and their object. See "Horizontal
  Spacing".

* Horizontal spacing for multi-line function calls should line up one or two
  tab stops after the beginning of the function name. See "Horizontal Spacing".

* Always put space after commas or semicolons that separate items. See
  "Horizontal Spacing".

* Always put space before an open parenthesis, except for macro definitions.
  See "Horizontal Spacing".

* Put space before an open brace if it is not on its own line. See "Horizontal
  Spacing".

* Do not put space around the structure member, '`.`', and pointer, '`->`',
  operators. See "Horizontal Spacing".

* Do not put space before the open brackets, '`[`' of array subscripts. See
  "Horizontal Spacing".

* Align a continuation line with the part of the line that it continues. See
  "Horizontal Spacing".

* Use parentheses instead of relying upon knowledge of C precedence ordering.
  See "Horizontal Spacing".

### 3.3.2 Include Files

* Every header file must have a '`#ifndef FILE_NAME_H_`' and '`#endif`' guard
  surrounding all code. See "Include Files".

  + The `#ifndef` must be the first line of code following the file header
    comment.

  + The `#endif` must appear alone on the last line in the file.

* All C include files shall use the same extension and it shall be `.h`. See
  "Include Files".

* Include statements shall not contain absolute paths or paths that contain
  '..'. See "#include"

* Functional macros are discouraged except for includes, debug, CR, and linked
  lists. See "Macros".

* Macros should be defined with the maximum use of parentheses to remove any
  possible ambiguity. See "Macros".

* Include files must contain either public or private data, not both. See
  "Include Files".

* Include files must not contain code generating statements. See "Include
  Files".

* Every parameter must have the proper `IN`, `OUT`, `OPTIONAL`, etc., modifiers.
  See "Function Definition Layout".

* Only use UEFI data types. Use of standard C data types is prohibited. See
  "Common Data Types".

### 3.3.3 Code Files

* Only use UEFI data types. Use of standard C data types is prohibited. See
  "Common Data Types".

* Code files should not contain `#define` and `typedef` statements.

* Do not use inline assembler in the source files. See "General Rules".

* Function definitions, as well as `if`, `for`, `while`, and `switch`
  statements, must follow strict rules. See "Function Definition Layout", "Flow
  Control Statements, and "Introducing Doxygen".

* Enumerated types must end with a maximum element. See "Enumerated Types".

* Enumerated types should begin with a minimum element.

* Structures are always defined with a `typedef` format. See "Structure
  Definitions".

* The open and closing braces of a function definition are in column one and on
  their own lines. See "Function Definition Layout".

### 3.3.4 Code Files: Vertical Spacing

* There shall be only one statement per line. See "Vertical Spacing".

* Open braces, '`{`', shall be on the same line as the closing parenthesis,
  '`)`', of one-line predicate expressions. See "Vertical Spacing".

* Open braces, '`{`', shall be on a line by themselves and aligned with the
  first character of the associated flow control statement when following a
  multi-line predicate expression. See "Vertical Spacing".

* Close braces, '`}`', always go at the beginning of the last line of the body.
  See "Vertical Spacing".

* A close brace may share a line with the `else {`, `else if () {`, and
  do-while constructs. See "Vertical Spacing".

* Each sub-expression of a complex predicate expression must be on a separate
  line. See "Vertical Spacing".

## 3.4 Documentation

### 3.4.1 Documentation: Commenting

* Comments must explain why the code does what it does. See "Comments".

* Every file must have a properly formatted file header. See "File Heading".

* Every function and functional macro must have a correct function header in
  both the source and include files. See "Macros" & "Function Headings".

#### 3.4.1.1 Documentation: Internal comments

* Local comments must use the C++ comment style, '`//`'. See "Internal
  Comments".

* Local comments must have a blank line before the comment block. See "Internal
  Comments".

* Comments must be indented to match the code. See "Internal Comments".

* If a comment applies to more than one block of code, there should be a blank
  line after the comment. See "Internal Comments".

* If a comment applies to a single block of code, there should **not** be a blank
  line separating the comment from the code. See "Internal Comments".

#### 3.4.1.2 Documentation: What not to comment

* **No** comment markers are allowed in code, including:
  + `BUGBUG`
  + Your name
  + Your initials
  + Special markers, such as `FIX_THIS`, `TEST` . See "What NOT to Comment".

* Use your bug tracking system to track bugs instead of markers within the
  code. If you really must mark the code, use Doxygen's `@bug` or `@todo`
  commands. See "What NOT to Comment".

### 3.4.2 Doxygen

* Doxygen comments are used to document global and file-scope elements. See
  "Global Comments".

* C-style comment blocks are of the form:
  ```c
  /** Brief Description.
   *  ... More text ...
  */
  ```

* C++ style comment blocks begin with `///`.

* Comments precede the semantic element they document. See "Special
  Documentation Blocks".

* The special form, `///< ...`, allows documentation to be after the documented
  element. See"Putting Documentation after Members".

* Comment blocks automatically start with a brief description and end at the
  first period. See "Special Documentation Blocks" .

* The most frequently used Doxygen commands are: ( See "Special Commands").

```c
@file [<name>]
@param[in, out] <parameter name> { parameter description }
@retval <return value> { description }
@sa { references }
@test { description of a test case }
```
